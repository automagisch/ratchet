# App Starter
A simple and clean boilerplate for quickly kickstarting new projects. Very minimal integration with much power.

## Basic guides

### Clone
Clone this remote repository to your computer:
```
$ git clone git@github.com:koenhoutman1991/app-starter.git
```

After you're done, navigate to the locally cloned repository:
```
$ cd app-starter
```

### Setup
Install all npm and bower dependencies (bower will be ran automagically after npm install finished):
```
$ npm install
```

### Start
Boot the server and start the gulp process simultaneously:
```
$ npm start
```

### Build
Build a single distribution build without watching or serving:
```
$ npm run build
```
